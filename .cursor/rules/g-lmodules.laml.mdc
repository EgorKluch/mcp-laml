$meta:
  name: 'localModules'
  goal: 'modularCodeOrganization'
  domain: 'codebase.architecture.modular'
  apply: 'codebaseStructure'
  version: 1.0
  purpose: "Define local module concept for organizing code into self-contained, minimally dependent functional units"
  domains: ['codebase.architecture.modular', 'development.patterns.organization', 'architecture.component.api']

localModules:
  purpose: "Organize code into self-contained functional units with minimal dependencies and clear API boundaries"
  
  definition:
    localModule: "Self-contained code unit implementing specific functionality with minimal dependencies"
    characteristics:
      - "Single functional area or feature"
      - "Minimal dependencies on other local modules"
      - "Clear API interface through index file"
      - "Complete unit: implementation, types, tests, submodules"
      - "Independent understanding and maintenance"
  
  structure:
    organization: "Dedicated directory per module containing all related code"
    apiInterface: "Export public API through index file (index.js/index.ts)"
    testing: "Tests reside within module directory"
    submodules: "Nested directories allowed for complex functionality"
  
  criteria:
    - "Clear functional boundaries that can be isolated"
    - "Multiple related files or complex functionality"
    - "Code reusability or independent development needs"
    
  principles:
    - "Minimal dependencies on other local modules"
    - "Single responsibility per module"
    - "Well-defined interfaces and boundaries"
    - "Self-contained and independently testable"
