```yaml
$meta:
  name: 'generalNamingConventions'
  goal: 'standardizeNamingAcrossProject'
  domain: 'development.standards.general'
  apply: 'allFileTypes'
  version: 1.1
  purpose: "Define universal naming conventions and general development standards"
  domains: ['development.standards.general', 'codebase.naming.conventions', 'workflow.consistency.standards']

naming:
  purpose: "Establish consistent naming patterns across the project"
  
  fileNaming:
    default: 'camelCase'
    description: "Files should use camelCase naming by default unless specifically overridden by domain-specific rules"
    examples:
      correct: ['userService.ts', 'apiClient.js', 'configParser.mdc']
      avoid: ['user_service.ts', 'api-client.js', 'config_parser.mdc']
    overrides: "Domain-specific rules may override this default (e.g., kebab-case for components, snake_case for database files)"
    
  consistency:
    principle: "Maintain consistent naming patterns within each domain"
    validation: "Check that naming follows established patterns for the specific file type and domain"

codeChanges:
  purpose: "Prevent unintended side effects when making code modifications"
  
  sideEffectPrevention:
    rule: "Check for potential side effects before making any code changes"
    description: "Before implementing any modification, analyze and verify that no additional unintended consequences will occur beyond what user explicitly requested"
    validation:
      - "Review impact on dependent modules and functions"
      - "Check for breaking changes to existing APIs"
      - "Verify no unintended behavioral changes"
      - "Confirm changes align strictly with user request scope"
    principle: "Make only the changes explicitly requested by the user, nothing more"
    
  changeScope:
    rule: "Limit modifications to exactly what user requested"
    description: "Avoid adding functionality, optimizations, or improvements that weren't specifically asked for"
    approach:
      - "Analyze user request to understand exact scope"
      - "Identify minimum necessary changes to fulfill request"
      - "Verify each change directly supports the stated goal"
      - "Ask for clarification if scope is ambiguous"

  functionPurity:
    rule: "Functions should be pure functions unless explicitly specified otherwise"
    description: "By default, functions should not have side effects and should return the same output for the same input"
    requirements:
      - "No modification of external state or variables"
      - "No I/O operations unless explicitly required"
      - "No mutation of input parameters"
      - "Predictable output based solely on input parameters"
    exceptions: "Only deviate from purity when explicitly requested or when function purpose clearly requires side effects"
    
  methodBehavior:
    rule: "Methods should have predictable behavior that aligns with their name and intended purpose"
    description: "Class methods should behave in ways that are reasonably expected based on their naming and context"
    approach:
      - "Method names should clearly indicate their primary purpose and expected behavior"
      - "Side effects should be reasonable and expected for the method's intended function"
      - "Avoid unexpected modifications that don't align with the method's apparent purpose"
      - "Common operational patterns (logging, caching, monitoring) are acceptable when they don't change core behavior"
    acceptablePatterns:
      - "Getters may perform internal optimizations (caching, lazy loading, memoization)"
      - "Any method may include logging, debugging, or monitoring operations"
      - "Methods may perform internal cleanup or state optimization"
      - "Performance-related internal modifications are generally acceptable"
    principle: "Focus on avoiding surprising or contradictory behavior rather than enforcing strict purity"

  codeStyleCompliance:
    rule: "Do not update existing code for style/pattern compliance without explicit user request"
    description: "Avoid refactoring existing working code to match current patterns unless specifically requested"
    approach: "Focus on new code following patterns rather than updating legacy code"
    exception: "Only update existing code style when user explicitly asks for refactoring or style improvements"
